## 3.1 Dataset used
The dataset used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius on Kaggle.

## 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data:
We can determine from the source website of the data, that this is an open source dataset. Under copyright law, we can copy, modify, distribute and perform works, even for commercial purposes, without asking permission. Provided the owner waives all his or her worldwide rights to the work to the extent permitted by law, thereby placing the work in the field of publication.

## 3.3 Information about dataset
These datasets were generated from a survey of 30 respondents conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016 and December 5, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users agreed to submit personal tracker data, including minute-by-minute output of physical activity, heart rate and sleep monitoring. Differences between outputs indicate use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behavior/preferences.

## 3.4 Data Organizasion and verification
There are 18 CSV files in the dataset. Each file contains different data tracked by FitBit. The data is considered long, because each row is one time point for each consumer. Hence, each consumer will have data in multiple rows. For each user, there is a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.
