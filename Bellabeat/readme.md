# 3. Prepare üé®
## 3.1 Dataset used
The dataset used for this case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius on Kaggle.

## 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data:
We can determine from the source website of the data, that this is an open source dataset. Under copyright law, we can copy, modify, distribute and perform works, even for commercial purposes, without asking permission. Provided the owner waives all his or her worldwide rights to the work to the extent permitted by law, thereby placing the work in the field of publication.

## 3.3 Information about dataset
These datasets were generated from a survey of 30 respondents conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016 and December 5, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users agreed to submit personal tracker data, including minute-by-minute output of physical activity, heart rate and sleep monitoring. Differences between outputs indicate use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behavior/preferences.

## 3.4 Data Organizasion and verification
There are 18 CSV files in the dataset. Each file contains different data tracked by FitBit. The data is considered long, because each row is one time point for each consumer. Hence, each consumer will have data in multiple rows. For each user, there is a unique ID and different rows since data is tracked by day and time.

## 3.5 Data credibility and intergrity
Since this set of data comes from a maximum of 33 users, we may run into sampling bias issues, and we are not sure that the samples in the data are representative of the entire general population. Another problem is that this set of data is basically based on one month's data. We can imagine a scenario where, say in winter, people find it difficult (for some) to get up early because of the low temperatures. During summer, we may (for some) become less active due to warmer temperatures, so time period constraints may also lead to gaps in our analysis results from the general truth.

# 4 Process üõ†
For this case study, I will use Microsoft excel and Microsoft SQL server to cleaning, analyse data. Then, create data visulasation using tableau to share my insight learnt from dataset to the stakeholders.

## 4.1 Import dataset
First, I convert CSV file to XLSX file to suit the import requirement of MS SQL server. 

## 4.2 Cleaning and formatting

### 4.2.1 Date formatting
For some reason, there is a part of date format over 18 files are string, which can cause a lot misleading. The image shows almost what is happen in all files. The top three rows are the date in the correct format, they could be transfer of format to different date type. However, the bottom 5 are in the text string format, which make them unconvertable. Because of the AM/PM at the end, function "Text to Columns" cannot recognize the cell. Hence, I separete them in to date and time, then convert them and combine the converted date and time to fix the date format issue.

### 4.2.2 Duplicates handelling
In this case study, I considered that a file has more than 1 record when the id and datetime is the same is duplicated. There are 2 files with duplicates. The first one is minuteSleep_merged file, user id 4702921684's information has been collected twice, this may because that this user have two deviced that record he/her stats at the same time. Hence, we created a new file minuteSleep_new_merged which maintain only non-duplicate record. The second file is sleepDay_merged, there are three records has been showns twice in the dataset, I filtered them out by creating a new file sleepDay_merged.
<br />

There are two columns in dailyActivity_merged dataset, TotalDistance and TrackerDistance. According to the fitabase data dictionary, TotalDistance is the total kilometres tracked (assume this is provide by the user's non-fitbit device, e.g. phone), TrackerDistance is the total kilometres tracked by Fitbit device. By checking the repeatability of these two column, there are only three record that have different value of TotalDistance and TrackerDistance, and the TotalDistance are always greater than the TrackerDistance. At the end, I droped the TotalDistance columns for a more compact dataset.

### 4.2.3 Removing nessesery data
In the dataset, there are two different ways of recording calories, intensity and steps in minute. They were called "wide" and "narrow". However, they are basicly holding the same data, the only differece is the data structure (as the table in 3.4 shown). Hence, I deviced to keep all the "narrow" dataset, and drop all the "wide" dataset.

### 4.2.4 Heart Rate dataset
heartrate_seconds_merged dataset with three attribute: id, date (accurate to the second) and value, and totally 1.04 million rows. It contains the users' heart rate in seconds, however, all other dataset are measured in minutes or hours or days. There is no point to be that accuracte for this case study. Hence, I create another file heartrate_minutes_merged to with the users' heart rate in minutes, and take the average of heart rate in a minute to calculate the new heart rate value. There are two main reason of this process:
- Decrease the data size from 1.04 million rows to 121 hundred rows.
- Able to combine with other dataset easily.
