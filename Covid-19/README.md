## 3.5 Data credibility and intergrity
The reliability and completeness of this database are relatively high, except for some countries or regions where data is missing or updated at different times than others (data for most countries is updated daily). This can be. It may cause the analysis results or the process of virus spread to have slightly deviated from the real results, but overall this is a very complete dataset.
